# 🐦 Bird Detection from Bird Chirping

This project focuses on detecting bird species from chirping audio recordings using deep learning. It leverages audio preprocessing techniques and neural network models to classify different bird sounds. The goal is to support ecological monitoring and species identification efforts.
